- **UI Implementation**: 1h - Built landing page, sign-in/sign-up forms, navigation components

### 🚧 **Challenges & Solutions**
- **Challenge**: Choosing between multiple tech stack options for rapid development
  **Solution**: Selected TypeScript + Vite + React + Supabase for simplicity and speed
- **Challenge**: Setting up optimal Kiro CLI workflow for hackathon efficiency
  **Solution**: Created specialized steering files and sub-agents for focused development

### 🧠 **Key Decisions**
- **Tech Stack Selection**: Chose TypeScript/Vite/React/Supabase for rapid development and simplicity
- **UI Framework**: Selected shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS for consistent, professional design system
- **Development Approach**: Prioritized speed and effectiveness over complex architecture
- **Kiro Workflow**: Invested time in proper setup to accelerate future development

### ⚡ **Kiro CLI Ecosystem Usage**

**Custom Prompts Used (PIV Loop):**
- `@add-to-devlog` - Creating this comprehensive development log entry
- Custom steering files created for project context and technical guidance

**Kiro CLI Built-in Commands Used:**
- `/context` - Managing project context and file references
- `/model` - Switching between AI models (primarily used auto mode)
- `kiro-cli agent swap [agent-name]` - Switching between specialized sub-agents
- Agent creation and configuration commands

**Kiro Workflow Demonstrated:**
- ✅ Created specialized sub-agents for focused development
- ✅ Leveraged steering documents as source of truth
- ✅ Used context management for efficient development
- ✅ Followed conventional commits with proper git workflow
- ✅ Integrated MCP servers for enhanced capabilities

### 📚 **Learnings & Insights**
- Proper Kiro CLI setup investment pays dividends in development speed
- Auto model mode provides excellent balance of performance and cost
- Steering files are crucial for maintaining project context across sessions
- Sub-agents enable focused, specialized development workflows

### 📋 **Next Session Plan**
- Complete authentication implementation with Supabase Auth
- Begin main app functionality development
- Implement YouTube channel integration pipeline
- Set up database schema and migrations
