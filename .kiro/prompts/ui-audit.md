Fully analyze the provided screenshot in detail to identify every visual, layout, and design issue, then apply comprehensive improvements to significantly enhance the UI.

## Core Principles

UI Audit Philosophy:
- Identify everything that looks inconsistent, poorly aligned, or aesthetically unpleasing
- Examine all aspects: spacing, typography, color, contrast, hierarchy, alignment
- Propose and apply comprehensive improvements for a major visual upgrade
- Create modern, polished, cohesive, and delightful user interfaces

## What to Analyze

Examine these visual elements thoroughly:
- **Layout & Spacing**: Alignment, padding, margins, rhythm, balance
- **Typography**: Font choices, sizes, weights, line heights, hierarchy
- **Color & Contrast**: Color harmony, accessibility, visual hierarchy
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Information priority, emphasis, flow, scanning patterns
- **Component Styling**: Consistency, polish, modern design patterns
- **Overall Aesthetics**: Visual appeal, cohesion, professional appearance

## Issues to Identify

Call out elements that are:
- **Inconsistent**: Breaking established patterns or design system
- **Poorly Aligned**: Misaligned elements, uneven spacing, visual chaos
- **Visually Cluttered**: Too much information, poor information hierarchy
- **Outdated**: Old design patterns, dated visual styles
- **Confusing**: Unclear navigation, poor user experience patterns
- **Aesthetically Unpleasing**: Colors, fonts, or layouts that feel awkward

## Enhancement Areas

Focus improvements on:
- **Layout Structure**: Grid systems, alignment, responsive behavior
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information priority and scanning flow
- **Spacing Rhythm**: Consistent, harmonious spacing throughout

- **Modern Standards**: Apply current design best practices and trends
- **Cohesive Design**: Ensure all changes work together harmoniously
