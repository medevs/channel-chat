# Product Overview

## Product Purpose
AI Creator Mentor Platform ChannelChat provides AI-powered mentorship based entirely on YouTube creators' own content. Users can add a YouTube channel and chat with an AI mentor that answers questions strictly using the creator's video transcripts. The AI refuses to answer questions not supported by the content, presents confidence indicators, and always cites exact video timestamps so users can verify insights directly. The goal is to make creator-level mentorship accessible without sacrificing trust, transparency, or accuracy.
